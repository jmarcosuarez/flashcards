Flashcards as a learning tool to aid memorization by means of spaced repetition.

This personal project is an universal app build with react/redux. Isomorphic boilerplate taken from the iso-stack project. Will be full-stack and the back-end tech stack will be Swagger and sequelize.

Right now just started, this is how the html templates look like right now:

### Installing

First install dependencies

```
npm install
```
This is a full stack app, therefore server side needs to be taken care off.
Go to the api folder and read instructions there (README.md)

To run in development:

```
npm run dev
```

To run in production:(without development reload features & other stuff) 

```
npm start
```


The app is running in localhost:3000
